// TypeErrors get thrown when a value is not of the expected type. JavaScript expected name to be a function since we're trying to invoke it. It was a string however, so a TypeError gets thrown: name is not a function!

// SyntaxErrors get thrown when you've written something that isn't valid JavaScript, for example when you've written the word return as retrun. 

//ReferenceErrors get thrown when JavaScript isn't able to find a reference to a value that you're trying to access.
