let's talk about how internet works

Internet has got the following components 

Let's divide and conquer the fundamentals around it 

Apranet Project 1960: US military wants an intelligent computer system to help them succeed, so they have joined a bunch of computers across the United states and wanted to secure their data and communication 
Eventually this private project has become a success and later was opened to public and was called Internet

But what is it actually?
Routers, modems, NATS : It is a group of some routers sending and receiving the data back and forth. Now this data can be moved across the nations with a low cost, security and with minimal infrastructure in those days. Eventually as the technology has grown the speed has tremendously improved and avaiability was opened to everyone.

Switches
Switches are the devices which will help carrying the signal from the Router to Router, it acts like an enhancer or multiplier

Isp - DNS
Internet service providers are a giant networks who participate in the internet with enough infrastructure to give the connectivity. They provide complex networking operation for Routing 

Packets
Data between the sender and Receiver. It has a data element and a header

Protocols - ip/ tcp - framework 
Protocols are the heart of trasnsmission, IP works to transport the data where as tcp helps to maintain the reliability - bascially tcp will help the receiver to have an handshake to keep track of all the data and retreive the missing packets

Data
It is just some data

client/server
Client is someone who consumes the services, client usually sends out the request and then the internet helps to get the service from the servers

Hops
Hops are small connectors, when ever the router travels from one point to the another to reach the final destination, all those points are called as Hops

LANS
Local area network, since the ipv4 addresses are limited, the internet is divided in to local and public internet. Private internet with NAT technology is called LAN

WANS
Wide area network, used to group many LANS together. If you take any giant corporation, you have a ton of networks divided across them, they are all called WANS

Ip4/IP6
The IP ranges used to make data communication

SSL/TSL
The network model is divided in to many layers to the related jobs, ssl and tsl sits right under the Application layer, their main function is to encrypt and decrypt the data so that the end user doesn't will have a secured communication channel - fully encrypted

http, https, imap, ssh, tcp, udp, ip
These are all protocols mainly used basing on the type of the Application used. For instance browser uses http and https, both these are used to render the text in to the browser.
Similarly imap and ssh are used by email and terminals etc to connect to the network
